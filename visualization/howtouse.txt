How to use graphs.py

First, locate People_*.csv files and Relation_*.csv files under the folder where graphs.py located.
Second, run graphs.py. It will require two inputs:Number of Meeting Cycles and Location of data
Number of Meeting Cycles means it will read People_0.csv, Relation_0.csv to People_n.csv, Relation_n.csv where n is the input. It must be bigger than 5.
Location of data is location of folder where the csv files are. If it is in the folder "output", then input will be output.

Then the graphs will be shown after few seconds.
